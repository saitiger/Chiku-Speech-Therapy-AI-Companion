# Speech Therapy App Implementation Plan

## 1. Adaptive Difficulty System

### Difficulty Level Criteria

#### Beginner Level
- **Content:** Short, simple sentences with basic vocabulary
- **Support:** Heavy visual cues, multiple-choice options, model responses
- **Expectations:** Basic responses, focus on participation and attempt
- **Prompting:** Direct questions, explicit instructions
- **User Interface:** Larger text, more animations, simplified choices

#### Intermediate Level
- **Content:** Complete sentences, moderate vocabulary
- **Support:** Some visual cues, fewer response options
- **Expectations:** Complete sentences, appropriate social responses
- **Prompting:** Less direct questions, some inference required
- **User Interface:** Standard text size, balanced visuals and text

#### Advanced Level
- **Content:** Complex sentences, advanced vocabulary, abstract concepts
- **Support:** Minimal visual cues, open-ended responses
- **Expectations:** Elaborate answers, reasoning, emotion recognition
- **Prompting:** Indirect questions, scenario-based problems
- **User Interface:** More text, fewer animations, challenging options

### Calibration System

The system will use a dual approach for level selection:

1. **Therapist Control**
   - Manual selection of difficulty level for each scenario
   - Override capability for specific skills (e.g., higher difficulty for vocabulary but lower for social skills)
   - Session planning tool to create customized sequence of scenarios

2. **AI Calibration**
   - Initial assessment to establish baseline performance
   - Continuous evaluation of performance across skills
   - Automatic adjustment recommendations based on:
     - Success rate (80%+ success suggests increasing difficulty)
     - Response time (significant delays suggest decreasing difficulty)
     - Complexity of language used (vocabulary diversity, sentence structure)
     - Emotional engagement (frustration detection suggests decreasing difficulty)

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - AI provides suggestions for level changes
   - Therapist approves or modifies suggestions
   - System logs all adjustments for progress tracking

## 2. Evaluation & Feedback Framework

### Comprehensive Rubric System

#### Speech & Language Skills (0-5 scale)
1. **Articulation**
   - Clear pronunciation of sounds
   - Age-appropriate mastery of difficult sounds
   - Consistency across different words
   - Self-correction attempts

2. **Fluency**
   - Appropriate speech rate
   - Minimal hesitations/repetitions
   - Smooth transitions between words
   - Natural rhythm and intonation

3. **Vocabulary**
   - Word choice appropriateness
   - Variety of terms used
   - Specificity vs. vagueness
   - Age-appropriate lexical diversity

4. **Grammar**
   - Correct sentence structure
   - Appropriate verb tense
   - Subject-verb agreement
   - Complexity of sentences

#### Social-Communication Skills (0-5 scale)
1. **Clarity**
   - Makes needs/thoughts understood
   - Organizes thoughts logically
   - Provides sufficient information
   - Stays on topic

2. **Empathy**
   - Recognizes others' emotions
   - Responds appropriately to feelings
   - Shows concern when appropriate
   - Adjusts communication based on others' needs

3. **Cooperation**
   - Takes turns appropriately
   - Follows social rules
   - Compromises when needed
   - Works toward shared goals

4. **Self-Control**
   - Manages frustration appropriately
   - Waits for turn to speak
   - Modulates volume appropriately
   - Demonstrates patience

### Feedback Delivery System

#### Immediate Feedback
- **Visual Cues:** Color-coding (green/yellow/red) for response quality
- **Audio Feedback:** Encouraging sounds for good responses
- **Character Reactions:** Animated expressions showing reaction to responses
- **Text Labels:** "Excellent," "Good," "Basic," "Needs Improvement"

#### Detailed Feedback
- Age-appropriate explanation of strengths
- One specific improvement suggestion
- Modeling of better response when needed
- Positive reinforcement of effort

#### Progress Reports
- Session summary showing scores across all 8 categories
- Trend analysis comparing to previous sessions
- Specific achievements highlighted
- Areas needing practice identified
- Recommendations for future sessions

## 3. Engagement Mechanics

### Reward System

#### Immediate Rewards
- **Stars:** 1-3 stars earned per scenario based on performance
- **Points:** Granular scoring that accumulates toward rewards
- **Praise:** Character-delivered verbal praise
- **Visual Effects:** Celebratory animations for achievements

#### Cumulative Rewards
- **Achievement Badges:** For mastering specific skills
- **Level Progression:** Unlock new scenarios and characters
- **Virtual Items:** Customization options for app environment
- **Special Activities:** Mini-games unlocked at milestones

### Character Progression System

#### Character Development
- **Customizable Avatar:** Child creates their own character
- **Growth Elements:** Character visually develops new skills
- **Skill Representation:** Visual indicators of mastered skills
- **Relationship Building:** NPC characters remember past interactions

#### World Exploration
- **Environment Unlocking:** New locations based on progress
- **Interactive Elements:** Increasing agency in the virtual world
- **Narrative Progression:** Ongoing story that develops with skills
- **Challenge Quests:** Special scenarios that test multiple skills

### Mini-Games System

#### Skill-Targeted Games
- **Articulation Games:** Sound-specific challenges (e.g., "S-Sound Safari")
- **Vocabulary Games:** Word categorization and collection activities
- **Fluency Games:** Rhythm and pacing challenges
- **Social Games:** Emotion recognition and response activities

#### Integration with Main Scenarios
- Games unlock based on needs identified in scenarios
- Performance in games influences scenario difficulty
- Points earned in scenarios can be spent in games
- Game achievements displayed alongside scenario achievements
